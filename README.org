Some PoC to play with Clojure webstuff and filesystems

* TODO
- Add functionality
- Private files, likely some visbility blacklist via uploading a special .private file containing newline-delimited filenames.
- Automatic tagging and search
  - Possibly some kind of usefulness/popularity ranking per tag
